This sections lists some ideas for extending the tutorial that you may wish to explore.

* Size of Input. Explore mode or fewer numbers of days used as input for the model, such
as three days, 21 days, 30 days and more.

* Model Tuning. Tune the structure and hyperparameters for a model and further lift model
performance on average.

* Data Scaling. Explore whether data scaling, such as standardization and normalization,
can be used to improve the performance of any of the CNN models.

* Learning Diagnostics. Use diagnostics such as learning curves for the train and validation
loss and mean squared error to help tune the structure and hyperparameters of a CNN model.

* Vary Kernel Size. Combine the multichannel CNN with the multi-headed CNN and use a 
different kernel size for each head to see if this configuration can further improve
performance.
